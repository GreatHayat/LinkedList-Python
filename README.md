<h1> Linked List Implementation in Python </h1>
<br>

<p>From this file you can lear how to implement Linked List Data Structure from scratch in Python. I have implemented the
following methods in this program
<ul>
  <li>Append Function</li>
  <li>Pre Apppend Function </li>
  <li>Insertion After Node</li>
  <li>Print the List </li>
  <li>Length of the List </li>
  <li>Delete an item from Linked List </li>
</ul>

But I'll add some more functions in it, so follow my profile to know more
</p>

<strong> Happy Coding! </stron>
